        toonSummary: ['Kim Dokja does not view himself as the main character in his own life, preferring solitude and spending his time reading web novels as his only pastime. He\'s particularly attached to Yoo Joonghyuk, the hero of Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse, and through his character, he\'s experienced the harrowing difficulties of time regression and the struggle to survive dangerous scenarios imposed on individuals by god-like entities known as Constellations. Dokja devotes himself to the novel and reads all 3,149 chapters, outlasting his peers who lost interest long before. Despite his disappointment in the story\'s conclusion, he receives a cryptic message from the author warning of future monetization before his surroundings turn pitch black, and he soon realizes he\'s living the novel\'s reality. As the only omniscient reader of the book\'s events, he\'s uncertain of his success in navigating the challenges to come, but he may now have the opportunity to embrace the protagonist he never felt suited for.'],

Her path to power seemed certain as she planned to wed Crown Prince Eros Orna Vasilios. However, her plans crumbled when the crown prince chose the innocent and unsuspecting Psyche Callista as his betrothed. Determined to secure her position on the throne, Lady Medea hatched a scheme to rid herself of her rival, even if it meant resorting to the most extreme measures. Her plan took her to the Yearly Prayer at the Temple where she came face to face with Psyche, who seemed oblivious to the immense powers she was soon to hold. In a moment of reckoning, Lady Medea found herself plunging into a seemingly never-ending fountain, as if by divine intervention. She prayed for her ultimate wish, to rule the empire, and her wish was granted. The cost of the granting of her wish, however, was to exchange bodies with Psyche. This turn of events held secrets and revelations beyond Medea\'s comprehension.'],

Her sorcery granted her the infamous title of Dark Lord, but a revered saint rose to challenge her tyranny. The holy being triumphed over the wickedness and shattered Calla\'s heart, creating a world free of darkness. From the foundation of the sacred Lampas Kingdom, the power to combat the resurrection of the evil was passed down to the holy knights. Many seek to join the ranks of these knights, but only a chosen few are successful. Among the hopefuls is Lapis, who has repeatedly failed the exams due to her inability to access divine energy. The truth is that Lapis is a magician, the bearer of the Dark Lord\'s cursed legacy destined to succumb to lunacy and transform into a malevolent creature. Lapis dreams of becoming a holy knight in the hope of thwarting her inevitable fate. Unintentionally bringing Calla back to life, Lapis discovers that even the original Dark Lord cannot halt the rise of magicians. Calla\'s demise and the ensuing curse have taken on a life of their own, beyond even her control. Calla offers to remove the magician\'s curse if Lapis retrieves the shattered remains of her heart.'],
